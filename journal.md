## My Journal

- (30/01/20) Made this repo, there was a typo in the name but I'm rolling with it. Might start to mess around with VAEs in pytorch, per the readings.
- (06/02/20) Finished writing a basic VAE class. Will try to replicate the MNIST figure, and then start to play around with changing the outputs.
